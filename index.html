For now there is not much here. If you are looking for the pretty pages all we got for you right now is this:
<p>
<a href="http://rawgithub.com/cefsharp/CefSharp/master/CefSharp.Example/Resources/Home.html">http://rawgithub.com/cefsharp/CefSharp/master/CefSharp.Example/Resources/Home.html</a> to get the 10.000 foot intro to CefSharp

BTW: That's also content shipped as part of the CefSharp.Wpf.Example or CefSharp.WinForms.Example demo applications.
